# Firebase Auth Quickstart

The Firebase Auth Unity Sample demonstrates user authentication and
user profile operations using
[Firebase Authentication](https://firebase.google.com/docs/auth/)
with the
[Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/docs/unity/setup).


## Requirements

* [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) 5.3 or higher.
* [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) 7.3 or higher
  (when developing for iOS).
* [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html#downloads)
  (when developing for Android).


## Building the Sample

### iOS

  - Register your iOS app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and associate your iOS application.
      - You should use `com.google.firebase.unity.auth.testapp` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.
    - Enable Authentication in the project.
      - Go to the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      - Select the *Auth* tab in the sidebar.
      - Select the *Sign-In Method* tab
      - Enable *Email/Password* and *Anonymous* sign-in providers.
    - Download the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file associated with your
      Firebase project from the console.
      This file identifies your iOS app to the Firebase backend, and will
      need to be included in the sample later.
    - For further details please refer to the
      [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/ios/setup)
      which describes how to configure a Firebase application for iOS.
  - Download the
    [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity)
    and unzip it somewhere convenient.
  - Open the sample project in the Unity editor.
    - Select the `File > Open Project` menu item.
    - Click `Open`.
    - Navigate to the sample directory `testapp` in the file dialog and click
      `Open`.
  - Open the scene `MainScene`.
    - Navigate to `Assets/TestApp/MainScene` in the `Project` window.
    - Double click on `MainScene` file to open.
  - Import the `Firebase Auth` plugin.
    - Select the `Assets > Import Package > Custom Package` menu item.
    - Import `FirebaseAuth.unitypackage` from the
      [Firebase Unity SDK](https://firebase.google.com/download/unity),
      downloaded previously.
    - Click the `Import` when the `Import Unity Package` window appears.
  - Add the `GoogleService-Info.plist` file to the project.
    - Navigate to the `Assets\TestApp` folder in the `Project` window.
    - Drag the `GoogleService-Info.plist` downloaded from the Firebase console
      into the folder.
      
      NOTE: `GoogleService-Info.plist` can be placed anywhere in the project.
  - Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier
    - If you did not use `com.google.firebase.unity.auth.testapp`
      as the project package name you will need to update the sample's Bundle
      Identifier.
      - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
      - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
      - Click `Player Settings`
      - In the `Player Settings` panel scroll down to `Bundle Identifier`
        and update the value to the package name you provided when you
        registered your app with Firebase.
  - Build for iOS
    - Select the `File > Build Settings` menu option.
    - Select `iOS` in the `Platform` list.
    - Click `Switch Platform` to select `iOS` as the target platform.
    - Wait for the spinner (compiling) icon to stop in the bottom right corner
      of the Unity status bar.
    - Click `Build and Run`.
  - See the *Using the Sample* section below.


### Android

  - Register your Android app with Firebase.
    - Create a project in the
      [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      and attach your Android app to it.
      - You should use `com.google.firebase.unity.auth.testapp` as the
        package name while you're testing.
        - If you do not use the prescribed package name you will need to update
          the bundle identifier as described in the
          `Optional: Update the Project Bundle Identifier` below.

      - To [generate a SHA1](https://developers.google.com/android/guides/client-auth),
        first you will need to set the keystore in the Unity project.
        - Locate the `Publishing Settings` under `Player Settings`.
        - Select an existing keystore, or create a new keystore using the toggle.
        - Select an existing key, or create a new key using "Create a new key".
      - After setting the keystore and key, you can generate a SHA1 by
        running this command:
        ```
        keytool -exportcert -list -v -alias <key_name> -keystore <path_to_keystore>
        ```
    - Enable Authentication in the project.
      - Go to the [Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/),
      - Select the *Auth* tab in the sidebar.
      - Select the *Sign-In Method* tab
      - Enable *Email/Password* and *Anonymous* sign-in providers.

        Firebase project from the console.
        This file identifies your Android app to the Firebase backend, and will
        need to be included in the sample later.
      - For further details please refer to the
        [general instructions](https://firebase.google.com/docs/android/setup)
        which describes how to configure a Firebase application for Android.

## Using the Sample

You must enable *Email/Password* and *Anonymous* authentication sign-in method
in your Firebase project in the
[Firebase console](https://firebase.google.com/console/) and also sign your
application with the key registered with the Firebase project otherwise
sign-in operations will fail.

The app provides email and password text input fields which control the
user associated with the action performed by each of the following buttons:

  - The `Create User` button attempts to register a user with the specified
    email and password.  If the user is already present an error will be
    reported.
  - The `Sign In With Password` button attempts to sign in the user with the
    specified email and password.  If the user is already signed in the
    sign-in process will fail.
  - The `Sign In With Credentials` button creates an Auth credential from the
    specified email and password.
  - The `Delete User` button attempts to delete the user associated with the
    specified email address.

The user database can be viewed in the
[Firebase console.](https://firebase.google.com/console/) by:
  - Selecting the `Auth` sidebar.
  - Selecting the `Users` tab.
